* [genes_of_interest](genes_of_interest) obtain Gene-Disease Associations from DisGeNET using an R script.
* [networks](networks) contains several Python scripts for building different networks (PPIs from different sources, random networks).
* [data_preprocessing](data_preprocessing) several scripts for obtaining genetic data from the different cohorts employed.
* [create_datasets](create_datasets) Python scripts for building different datasets for supervised classification models.
  * [create_nx_datasets.py] is the one for building graph-datasets for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
* [ml_models](ml_models) Machine learning models for comparing with GNNs.
* [data](data) contains several data files used in this work. Please note genetic data coming from the cohorts employed is not available due to privacy reasons.
* [results](results) contains several files with the results presented in this work
